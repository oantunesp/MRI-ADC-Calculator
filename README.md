# MRI-ADC-Calculator
This is an app that calculates the ADC value from two values of intensity in for a given magnetic field. It is useful for MR that generates ADC maps without real values.
You should measure the intensity signal in B0 and then in the second B (usually B1000).
It basically works as an Excel formula. But this is more cool.
